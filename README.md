## Inspiration

There are more than 27,000 pieces of orbital debris, with smaller pieces in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO). This is a large threat to future space travel, as ignoring the problem may make it impossible to leave our planet. 

## What it does

Our product, Spacycle, turns this problem into a profitable opportunity for space agencies around the world. 

## How we built it

Spacycle uses a deep neural network and a website. 

## Challenges we ran into

We ran into issues finding a dataset to accurately classify collected debris.
